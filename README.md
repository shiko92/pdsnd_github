### Description
This project was written in **pyhton 3.0** it was a practical implementation of the second part of this ***nanodegree program.*** In this project I used 3 libraries

* pandas
* numpy

In this project the user can filter the data by:
 1. *city (Chicago, New York city or Washington)*
 2. *month*
 3. *day* <br/>
also the user has the choice to choose all months and days too. <br />
