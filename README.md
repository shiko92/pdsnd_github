### Filter bikeshare data based on user inputs


### Description
This project was written in **pyhton 3.0** it was a practical implementation of the second part of this ***nanodegree program.*** In this project I used 3 libraries
* time  
* pandas
* numpy

In this project the user can filter the data by:
 1. *city (Chicago, New York city or Washington)*
 2. *month*
 3. *day* <br/>
also the user has the choice to choose all months and days too. <br />

#### statistics to be shown from the provided data are:
1. the most frequent times of travel
2. the most popular stations and trip
      * *display most commonly used start station*
      * *display most commonly used end station*
      * *display most frequent combination of start station and end station trip*
3. the total and average trip duration
     * *display most frequent combination of start station and end station trip*
     * *display mean travel time*
4. statistics on bikeshare users if provided:
     * *display counts of user types*
     * *display counts of gender*
     * *display earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth* <br />

*After* that the script asks the users if he would like to see some raw data from the filtered data, if user say yes has to choose from
1. **Random raw data** followed by how many **rows** he want to preview
2. **specific row data** followed by **start row number** and **end row number** <br />

<span style="font-size:larger;">Finaly</span> the scripts ask the user if he would like to restart the filtering process again
